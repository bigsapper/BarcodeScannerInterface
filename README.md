# BarcodeScannerInterface
C# interface for the Symbol Technologies CS1504

This was mostly an exercise in using P/Invoke but I also built an application around this, so it is functional.
Code was provided to Symbol Technologies for inclusion in their SDK for the product.

If you're not familiar with calling directly into Windows DLLs or programming the CS1504 barcode scanner, make sure you read the SDK documentation.
